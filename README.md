# Fire data

A repository of data for registers of UK fire authorities and fire stations.

The new regulator (as of June/July 2017) is [Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Constabular and Fire & Rescue
Services](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/fire-and-rescue-services/).
They're currently (Dec 2017) consulting about how to inspect fire and rescue
services, and don't publish much data yet, but they link to all the authorities'
websites, so this repo contains data taken from those.
